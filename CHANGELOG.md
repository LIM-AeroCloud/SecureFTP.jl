## [v0.1.0] - 2025-04-23

The initial release is based on [SFTPClient (v0.4.4)](https://github.com/stensmo/SFTPClient.jl/releases/tag/0.4.4).
All changes for this released are documented in respect to this version.

### Added

- Initial release with new project name SFTP.jl and new initial version v0.1.0
- Prefer `Logging` over simple print commands
- Overload `stat` with simplified `stat` method for a single path object
  (in contrast to `statscan` that scans the whole folder) and return an `SFTP.StatStruct`
- Overlaod Base functions for the file system; new methods added for:
  - `ispath`
  - `pwd`
  - `mkdir` (previous `mkdir` was renamed to `mkpath`)
  - `joinpath`
  - `splitdir`
  - `basename`
- Add labels for docs, CI status and Codecov in Readme
- Add workflow for compat helper
- Add changelog and automate with Changelog.jl

### Changed

- Update API
  - exported: `upload`, `statscan`,`URI`
  - public: `Client`, `StatStruct`, `download`, `stat`, `filemode`, `ispath`,
    `isdir`, `isfile`, `islink`, `pwd`, `cd`, `mv`,`rm`, `mkdir`, `mkpath`, 
    `readdir`, `walkdir`, `joinpath`, `splitdir`, `basename`
- Completely refactor code base, use concise variable names, format source code
- Rename `SFTPStatStruct` to `StatStruct` (unexported) and refactor constructors
- Rename `SFTP` to `Client` (unexported) and refactor constructors
- Rename `sftpstat` to `statscan`
- Rename `mkdir` to `mkpath` (as it has the functionality of `mkpath`, add new method for `mkdir`)
- Update functionality of file system functions to more close resemble Julia's Base functions
  - Combine `rm`/`rmdir` in `rm` with a `force` flag
  - Sort results in `readdir`, `stat`, `statscan`, and `walkdir` (can be switched off with `sort`
    flag)
  - Introduce more checks and restrictions based on Julia's file system function/Unix functions
  - Check validity of a path
  - Add methods to pass a path as `String` to `filemode` and related functions instead of 
    a `StatStruct` object
  - Allow recursive methods, where appropriate
- Allow upload/download of directories
  - Add `force`/`merge` flag
  - Allow filtering of hidden files
  - Update and unify how paths are defined on the remote and local system
- Refactor and extent tests
- Update documentation

### Removed

- Remove `CSV` as dependecy and use `readlines` instead
- Remove `FileWatching`, `ArgTools`, and `NetworkOptions` as dependency

### Fixed

- Overload `walkdir` and `download` instead of defining new functions
- Ensure Windows paths are processed correctly
- Several fixes concerning the representation of paths (especially under Windows)
- Symlinks are now recognised by `stat`/`statscan`
- `walkdir` correctly follows symlinks
