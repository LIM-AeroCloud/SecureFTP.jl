# Filesystem functions

_SFTP.jl_ overloads a number of Julia's Base Filesystem functions to navigate and
manipulate server paths and retrieve stats on path objects (files, symlinks or folders).
The SFTP filesystem methods mimic Julia's Filesystem functions or Linux filesystem
functions, respectively, however, _SFTP.jl_'s functionality might be reduced.

## URI

Several of the Filesystem functions return a `URI` struct from the
[URIs package](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/URIs.jl.git) to represent the complete
server address including the path on the server. `URI` structs are also accepted as
input argument by serveral of _SFTP.jl_'s Filesystem functions.
For easier handling, the `URI` struct is exported by _SFTP.jl_ as well. See
[URIs' documentation](https://docs.juliahub.com/URIs/eec2u/1.5.1/#URIs.URI)
for more details on the `URI` struct.

## Navigating server paths

!!! warning "Deprecation warning"
    The [`pwd`](@ref) method for `URI` structs will be deprecated in v0.2.0 and
    replaced by and internal `cwd` method to avoid type piracy.

```@docs
pwd
cd(::SFTP.Client, ::AbstractString)
mv(::SFTP.Client, ::AbstractString, ::AbstractString; force::Bool=false)
rm(::SFTP.Client, ::AbstractString; recursive::Bool=false, force::Bool=false)
mkdir(::SFTP.Client, ::AbstractString)
mkpath(::SFTP.Client, ::AbstractString)
readdir(::SFTP.Client, ::AbstractString; kwargs...)
walkdir(::SFTP.Client, ::AbstractString; kwargs...)
```

## Analyse and manipulate server paths

!!! warning "Deprecation warning"
    All methods using `URI` instead of [`SFTP.Client`](@ref) in [`basename`](@ref)
    and [`splitdir`](@ref) will be deprecated in v0.2.0 to avoid type piracy.

!!! warning "Known issue"
    [URIs'](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/URIs.jl.git) `joinpath` method currently
    assigns two leading slashes (`//`) instead of one, if an absolute path is assigned
    to an empty URI path. This issue is addressed in
    [PR #62](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/URIs.jl/pull/62).

```@docs
joinpath
splitdir
dirname
basename
```

## Getting statistics on path objects

The [`SFTP.StatStruct`](@ref) holds all relevant information on server path objects.
It can be directly analysed by functions analysing the filemode ([`filemode`](@ref),
[`isdir`](@ref), [`isfile`](@ref) or [`islink`](@ref)). For these functions, additional
convenience methods exist, which take the `SFTP.Client` and an `AbstractString` of the
`path` as input arguments.

!!! tip
    [`statscan`](@ref) should be preferred, whenever several objects are analysed
    in the same folder. Further analysis should be performed on the `SFTP.StatStruct`
    rather than with the convenience functions to improve performance.  
    The convenience functions are mainly for single operations or when interactively
    exploring a server, but can mean significantly longer processing times for large
    folders on the server. Internally, the whole folder content is always scanned and
    the stats for the desired files are then retrieved from all scans.

```@docs
SFTP.StatStruct
```

```@docs
statscan
stat(sftp::SFTP.Client, ::AbstractString)
filemode
ispath(::SFTP.Client, ::AbstractString)
isdir
isfile
islink
```
